# atom_snippets
A centralized location for synchronizing ATOM snippets.cson file across various development machines.


I often find myself coming up with good ideas across multiple machines, OS's, and installs of Atom.  I will sometimes
forget which machine has what snippets and try to use a snippet that doesn't exist on my current machine.  To alleviate this
I am trying to simply centralize all the snippets I have found useful.  This is not intended for anyone else but myself
so some snippets may not make any sense for another's workflow.  However, if someone finds these helpful then I am happy to share.
